# CSE15L LAB 5 REPORT 

For the lab report this week, I am going to replicate an EdStem conversation that a student and a TA would have. 

**Part 1**

**Student**

Hello, I'm using a mac operating system, and I'm coding on VS Code for Lab 3. I'm not sure why my code is failing the test. 
I created a test.sh file to test my files when I call <bash test.sh>, I'm prompted with an index out of bounds error. 

Heres my code

**TA Response**

Hi! (insert student name)
It seems like you have two bugs in your code in reverseInPlace() and reversed(), more specifically inside the for loops. 
I wrote down some hints for you in the image below.
